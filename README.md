# Zero Hour Game Jam 2022

This game is a submission for the Zero Hour Game Jam 2022. There is a playable [demo](https://epaezrubio.itch.io/the-floor-is-lava) on itch.io.

The game was developed in an hour, so please do not expect good code practices, exciting gameplay, or anything like that :) Still, the result is decent.

Assets not included in this repo:

- TextMesh Pro
- [Character movement fundamentals](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/physics/character-movement-fundamentals-144966)
